	<string name="empire_state_heading">Empire State Building</string>
	<string name="empire_state_desc">Located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the Empire State
        Building Experience is more than just a view. Embark on a journey through one of the most
		famous landmarks in the world, where you will experience the Art Deco lobby and murals, the
        historical “Dare to Dream” exhibit, and sustainability exhibit. Learn the fascinating
        history of the building\'s construction, restoration and industry-leading sustainability
        retrofit. Take in New York\'s most breathtaking views from its open-air observatory. See
        New York\'s world-famous skyline as it was meant to be seen—until 2am every night. </string>

	<string name="brooklyn_bridge_heading">Brooklyn Bridge</string>
	<string name="brooklyn_bridge_desc">Stretching across the East River, the iconic Brooklyn
        Bridge opened up back in 1883 to carry traffic (nonautomotive at the time) between Lower
        Manhattan and Brooklyn. One of the most recognizable parts of the New York City skyline,
        the bridge has been featured in movies and on television shows, and is a real piece of
        New York City history. A stroll across the elevated pedestrian walkway provides a true
        New York City experience. The Manhattan-side entrance is at Park Row and Centre Street,
        across from City Hall Park, east of City Hall; over on the Brooklyn side, enter at Cadman
        Plaza East or where Boerum Place meets Tillary Street.</string>
	<string name="brooklyn_bridge_address">Brooklyn Bridge, New York, NY 10038</string>
	
	<string name="one_world_heading">One World Observatory</string>
	<string name="one_world_desc">There are a million things to experience in New York City and
        only one way to truly see them all. Start by ascending to the top of the tallest building
        in the Western Hemisphere in less than 60 seconds; look toward the horizon and feel the
        City\’s invincible spirit. Explore three levels filled with innovation and inspiration at
        One World Observatory, located in the top three floors of One World Trade Center. </string>
	<string name="one_world_address">285 Fulton St, New York, NY 10006</string>
	
	<string name="liberty_heading">Statue of Liberty National Monument</string>
	<string name="liberty_desc">The Statue of Liberty is perhaps New York City\'s most familiar
        landmark and the easiest one to overlook since it\'s only accessible by boat. This
        historic monument has welcomed so many generations of hopeful Americans to our shores.
        The American Family Immigration History Center at Ellis Island contains more than 25
        million Port of New York passenger arrival records and 900 ship pictures circa 1892–1924.

	<string name="central_park_heading">Central Park</string>
	<string name="central_park_desc">Central Park is the largest park in Manhattan and without a
        doubt the most famous in all of NYC. Established in 1857, the 843-acre oasis has served
        as the scenic backdrop in countless movies and TV shows and functions as a kind of
        all-encompassing public recreation area. Its many attractions include a zoo, an
        ice-skating rink, a concert venue and several restaurants—not to mention its open fields,
        woodlands, running paths and various bodies of water. Located in the middle of Manhattan,
        the park, as its name suggests, is at the center of it all. </string>
